# Mini Project – AAMI Insurance Operations (Policy & Claims Lifecycle)
## What I have done?
- Analysed end‑to‑end insurance operations for AAMI, covering policy management, customer management, claims processing, payments/billing, discounts, and SME business insurance.
- Mapped key processes such as new policy application, endorsements, renewals/cancellations, claim lodgement and assessment, express settlements, and premium payment workflows.
- Identified data entities and business rules for premium calculation, discount eligibility, risk profiling, and policy–customer–claim relationships to support AI/automation opportunities.
- Highlighted automation use cases (e.g., express claims, reminders, discount assignment) to inform potential AI solutions for operational efficiency and improved customer experience.
